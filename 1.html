Hi <a href="https://blog.naver.com/nagano_i" target=
"_blank">Darling</a>. <br>
I'm extreamly love to see you.<br>

<strong>You are my wonderful <u>baby</u>. </strong>
<p>Dear little one,</p><br>
It won't be long now until I can see your sweet face,<br>
touch your soft skin and whisper in your ear the collection
of thoughts that I have complied for you over
the past nine months.<br>
It's been a true honor little one.<br>
Neither the sun nor stars could possibly
shine as brightly as my heart does for you
already.<br>
I will forever be grateful for our time spent
together while you were in my belly and for
the moments that have yet to come.<br>
I also promise to pause when the world gets
too busy and try my best to see life through
the rose colored glasses that you have chosen
to put on for that day.<br> I can only imagine
how much more beautiful life will be through
your eyes.<br>
<p style="margin-top:40px;">You are our greatest adventure</p>
You are our greatest adventure-and
while your father and I will remain
the center of this family,
you will fit perfectly into
the life that we have worked
so hard to build thus far.<br>
I have no doubt that you will
bring more joy and bliss than
we ever could have imagined.<br>
So come soon sweet child and always
remember that I love you to the moon and back.<br>
I simply can't wait to meet you!<br>
Love,<br>
Your Mama<br>
